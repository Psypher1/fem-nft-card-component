### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```

### Continued development

- Getting a better undestanding of overlay on hover.

### Useful resources

- [Open Props](https://open-props.style/) - This simplified having to figure out spacing and size values.
- [Conquering Responsive Layouts](https://courses.kevinpowell.co/conquering-responsive-layouts) - This course is a must for anyone serious about understanding CSS.
