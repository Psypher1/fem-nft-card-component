- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- Positioning and layout - the order to lay things in to not cause problem later.

### Continued development

- Getting a better undestanding of overlay on hover.

### Useful resources

- [Conquering Responsive Layouts](https://courses.kevinpowell.co/conquering-responsive-layouts) - This course is a must for anyone serious about understanding CSS.
